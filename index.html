        <h3>FDG 2024 Conference Web Presence</h3>

      <p>
        The international Foundations of Digital Games conference (FDG) series, operated annually by the
        <a class="width-kept" href="https://sasdg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          <span>Society for the Advancement of the Science of Digital Games</span>
        </a> (SASDG),
        is a nexus for critical discussion and exploration in the academic space of game
        design and immersive play.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not be prouder to have served as the Web Chair and website developer for its 19th consecutive conference
        session, FDG 2024, hosted at my very own home institution of WPI.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I coordinated with our academic stakeholders, as well as sponsor representatives from Studios
        Quality-Xbox Game Studios, I took pride in ensuring our central conference motif of inclusivity
        and community remained at the forefront. Color was crucial: the site is introduced with the warm hues
        of our campus in the spring, and the color-spectrum theme that follows evokes unity
        and builds a visual brand familiar to attendees of the conference in the last few years (e.g. 2021, 2023).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our wonderful logo designed by alum Hannah Belan was my core reference; I was beyond
        pleased that many attendees thought the site and logo were created by the same person due to their consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing the HTML and stylesheet from scratch, I sought animations that made the site feel lively
        yet avoided superfluous Javascript or problems with accessibility.
        To this end I harnessed CSS flex transitions, especially noticeable in the tactile "file cabinet rifling"
        metaphor of the site navigation tabs. It was far preferable to use the constraints of CSS to guide me
        rather than fighting against it in the creative process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also found this a delightful way to connect with our audience via an interactive reference. Harnessing something
        familiar in our professional world, and transforming it into both a signifier and an engaging toy at once – does that not
        capture the core magic of games academia?
